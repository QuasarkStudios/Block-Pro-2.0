Welcome to BlockPro 2.0!

BlockPro 2.0 is the second iteration of the first application I published onto the App Store, BlockPro 1.0. Originally intended to serve as a significant update to 1.0, BlockPro 2.0 evolved into an entirely new and rewrriten application that built upon some of the most popular features of 1.0, such as Time Blocks and Collaborations, in addition to adding new features such as instant messaging, adding attachments, monitoring the progress and activity of team members and more!
